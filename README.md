This is the Bundled Items Mod. A Simple mod by puxped (Enderman842), previously under the Ember development team. This mod lets you bundle your items, essentially making a storage block of frequently acquired items so they use less valuable space in your inventory.

To create a bundle, all you will need is 9 of an item that can be bundled, with only a few bundles requiring you to collect another item. (i.e Bowls, Paper, or Glass Vials, crafted with 1 glass block)
All bundles stack to 32, meaning you can have a maximum of 288 items in a single slot!

Shift-Right-Click to Decraft a bundle on the go.
